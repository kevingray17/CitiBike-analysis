# Covid-19 effects on the CitiBike System

### Summary
Using data made available by New York City's CitiBike bikeshare program, I performed an analysis to look at how the pandemic affected ridership in April 2020, as related to April 2019. Overall, there was a more than 60 percent decrease in ridership, which was to be expected as the city was in the grips of the worst of the Covid-19 crisis. 
It's telling to look at how riders changed their habits; for example ending more trips in greenspaces like parks than in what presumably were their workplaces, as in April 2019.
